## Optional Team/Venue Dataset (Advanced)

To improve coverage for team-driven searches (including NCAA programs) without relying solely on suggestions, you can provide a curated dataset that augments the built-in mappings.

- Path: `data/team_venues.json`
- Example: `data/team_venues.json.example`
- Schema per record:
  - `key` (string) canonical team key, e.g., `georgia bulldogs`
  - `league` (string) e.g., `nfl`, `nba`, `mlb`, `nhl`, `mls`, `ncaa_fbs`, `ncaa_fcs`
  - `city` (string)
  - `venue` (string)
  - `lat` (number), `lon` (number)
  - `venue_id` (number, optional)
  - `variations` (string[], optional) name and nickname variations
  - `aliases` (string[], optional) city aliases (e.g., `Athens GA`)

When present, this file is loaded at runtime and merged into the universal searchâ€™s team and city maps.
